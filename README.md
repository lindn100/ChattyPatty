# ChattyPatty

Currently set up to run on localhost. We attempted to set an IP using the dockerfile set up (172.17.0.2), but when we tried this, we got a connection refused error. We tried everything we could to resolve this, but couldn't figure it out. Thus, we are submitting with localhost as the default in the ChatClient, but this would have to be changed to get the dockerfile to work properly.
